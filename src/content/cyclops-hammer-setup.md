I try setting up a Cyclops Hammer and was about as smooth as a brick.

Ended up running through about five bike shops to find a 11-speed cassette:

* Red Lantern
* REI
* Sids Bikes
* Chelsea Bikes
* King Kog — SUCCESS!

Next I’ll be doing a review of the Cyclops Hammer using it for Zwift. I’ve had a few trial runs, but it’s too soon to have a relevant opinion yet.
