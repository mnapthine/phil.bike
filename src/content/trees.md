Living on a bike and riding around the place without a car you'd think your carbon footprint was pretty low, but I did some math and mine is still awful. The average American pumps 50,000 lb of CO2 into the air annually, which is about 4,100 a month, and about 140 lb a day. In contrast, [bike tour life](/euro-trip-two-months/) creates 40 lb a day from hotels and 15 lb a day from meals ([source](https://carbonfund.org/how-we-calculate/)), which is about 1,650 lb a month.

By camping on the weekends I can get down from 1,650 to 1,250 a month. Doing all of this only gets me down to 1/4th of the average person. Avoiding CO2 is hard, and everyone needs to do what they can. [Calculating your footprint](https://carbonfund.org/calculate-your-footprint/) is a good start, and reducing how much you output is the next step.

Too many people hope science is gonna fix it. Billionaires and scientists are [scaling up carbon trapping programs](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/04/carbon-emissions-negative-emissions-technologies-capture-storage-bill-gates) with big old turbines, even looking at turning that byproduct into fuel, but that wont be enough. We need to [reforest an area the size of the USA](https://theconversation.com/reforesting-an-area-the-size-of-the-us-needed-to-help-avert-climate-breakdown-say-researchers-are-they-right-119842) as quickly as possible. Why the urgency? We're rapidly reaching a point where large areas of the planet will be too hot to plant forests, so we need to get it done now. The [heatwave across Europe this June](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-48756480) was abnormal, and in France alone 15,000 people died, and it was brutally hot all the way through Europe as far as Hungary.

The UK was down to about 6% woodland not so long ago. Right now we're at 13% which isn't great either, but [there are projects on the go](https://www.citylab.com/environment/2018/01/northern-forest-united-kingdom/550025/). France is 31% which is somewhat ok for a developed country, and Finland is straight crushing it with 71%. Good job Finland, but so many developing countries could do with extra help!

The [Eden Project](https://edenprojects.org/) are working to reforest Nepal, Madagascar, Haiti, Indonesia, and Mozambique, and I would like y'all to help me throw some money at them.

[Sponsor me](https://edenprojects.org/user/philsturgeon/), to keep on cycling around, sharing stupid stories, fighting the mosquitos, trying to keep the footprint as low as possible. I'm saving some money by camping out in the woods, so lets throw that back into more trees, which means I'll throw in $1 for every $5 you donate.

Trees soak up some of the CO2 we're constantly pumping out, help retain water, stop soil erosion, on islands they can help reduce the impact of tidal waves, and along roads they can stop cyclists getting blasted full pelt in the face with 25mph headwinds for an entire week straight.

Even if you're fine with living in a barren world with vanishing fertile soil causing rapidly creeping desertification interspersed with mass flooding from a busted water cycle, and rapid cycle of destroying whatever woodland has not already arbitrarily caught on fire in order to make more farmland, think about how much better it is riding through woods than open fields.

**[Donate Tree Money to Eden Project, $1 = 10 trees](https://edenprojects.org/user/philsturgeon/)**

_After you've donated, forward the confirmation/receipt to hey@phil.bike or let me know on [@philsturgeon](https://twitter.com/philsturgeon) and I'll top up the total._

## July 2019

In the last few weeks so many people have helped me on my trip, that I'm starting to donate on their behalf. For example, a Bosnian man heard me struggling to order some food in German, so he played translator and had a chat with me about my trip, his visit to Dover for work, and after he want back to his mate he sent me over a lemonade!! Two bike shops now have refused my money too, in Hungary and Serbia. They just want to help me get where I'm going.
