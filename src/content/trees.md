Living on a bike and riding around the place without a car you'd think your carbon footprint was pretty low, but I did some math and mine is still awful. The average American pumps 50,000 lb of CO2 into the air annually, which is about 4,100 a month, and about 140 lb a day. In contrast, [bike tour life](/euro-trip-two-months/) creates 40 lb a day from hotels and 15 lb a day from meals ([source](https://carbonfund.org/how-we-calculate/)), which is about 1,650 lb a month.

By camping on the weekends I can get down from 1,650 to 1,250 a month. Doing all of this only gets me down to 1/4th of the average person. Avoiding CO2 is hard, and everyone needs to do what they can. [Calculating your footprint](https://carbonfund.org/calculate-your-footprint/) is a good start, and reducing how much you output is the next step.

Too many people hope science is gonna fix it. Billionares and scientists are [scaling up carbon trapping programs](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/04/carbon-emissions-negative-emissions-technologies-capture-storage-bill-gates) with big old turbines, even looking at turning that byproduct into fuel, but that wont be enough. We need to reforest as much of the planet as possible too. The UK was down to about 6% woodland not so long ago. Right now we're at 13% which isn't great either, but [there are projects on the go](https://www.citylab.com/environment/2018/01/northern-forest-united-kingdom/550025/). France is 31% which is somewhat ok, and Finland is straight crushing it with 71%. Good job Finland, but so many developing countries could do with extra help!

The [Eden Project](https://edenprojects.org/) are working to reforest Nepal, Madagascar, Haiti, Indonesia, and Mozambique, and I would like y'all to help me throw some money at them.

[Sponsor me](https://edenprojects.org/user/philsturgeon/), to keep on cycling around, sharing stupid stories, fighting the mosquitos, trying to keep the footprint as low as possible. I'm saving some money by camping out in the woods, so lets throw that back into more trees, which means I'll throw in $1 for every $5 you donate.

**[Donate Tree Money to Eden Project, $1 = 10 trees](https://edenprojects.org/user/philsturgeon/)**

Trees soak up some of the CO2 we're constantly pumping out, help retain water, stop soil erosion, on islands they can help reduce the impact of tidal waves, and along roads they can stop cyclists getting blasted full pelt in the face with 25mph headwinds for an entire week straight.

Even if you're fine with living in a barren world with vanishing fertile soil causing rapidly creeping desertification interspersed with mass flooding from a busted water cycle, and rapid cycle of destroying whatever woodland has not already arbitrarily caught on fire in order to make more farmland, think about how much better it is riding through woods than open fields.

Before the end of June I want to hit 5,000 trees, so start [donating now](https://edenprojects.org/user/philsturgeon/), and/or set up a monthly subscription with [Offset Earth](https://offset.earth/).

After you've donated, forward the confirmation/receipt to hey@phil.bike or let me know on [@philsturgeon](https://twitter.com/philsturgeon) and I'll top up the total.
