When you spend $900 on some fancy power pedals, you kinda hope the hardware won't literally fall apart while the software bugs out every few minutes. These things have annoyed me since 4 weeks into buying them back in February, until finally replacing them with dumb pedals 6,000km later.

The software: would just stop reporting and show either 0 or --, then seem to report all at once and show 7438w. I wish! This ride was the most noticable nonsense: [There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and Garmin Vector power numbers](https://www.strava.com/activities/2396699295). 

Smashing along the river into a headwind, 40w.

Climbing up a 5% gradient with a fully loaded rack and shit gearing, 80w. 

Yes their replacement battery covers could solve some of the dropout issues, but the pedal body is trash too.

2 stars for these pedals. At least Garmin are sending out some replacements. 

Maybe I'll give the replacements a try when im done touring, or maybe just sell them. Power in the pedals made some sense when I was going to Canary Islands with my Cross Check (only road bike after Super Six died), but if you can get any sort of [Quarq](https://www.quarq.com/product-category/road-triathlon/roadtri-power-meters/crank-power-roadtri-power-meters/) or other crankset power meter I'd recommend that. 

I'll be going back to Quarq when I get a new racing bike for sure.
