Two months ago I set off from Spain heading north, with no real goals other than
"hit as many countries as you can and do a good job at your day job", with my

## Losing Shit

**My WHOLE WALLET:** A few days prior to actually getting started I lost my whole damn wallet, riding the bike back from Madrid to Calpe. It was before I got my bags setup good, and I had a water bottle in the same jersey pocket as some cards. I think they got stuck on moisture and jumped out.

Luckily had a card on Apple Pay. Tried a few hotels until they took it, and bought a train ticket online. Props to Monzo for rushing me that replacement debit card!

**Washbag:** Left my whole wash bag, with my clippers (hence the crazy beard), painkillers, asthma thing, all sorts of stuff. Very much lighter now but when I'm mushing it up a giant hill I really miss my "sports educed asthma fixer".

**Left Shoe:** After a very bad day of bike trouble, I lost my running shoe which was in a side pocket on my pannier. Got some replacement hiking shoes on the cheap (I am not going to go for a jog on a rest day but I'd love a stroll about). Now they live in my backpack which is bungee corded to the rack.

**Apple Macbook Charger:** Checking out of Monaco hotel I pulled the charger out of the wall and knocked over a coffee, rushing as I was waaaaay past checkout. I think I just left it there, but luckily the USB-C Macbooks can charge off of pretty much anything, including my "Fast Charge" (USB-PB) power thing. It's 14w instead of 60w so shit takes a while, but it works.

**My "Fast Charge" power thing:** Lost that too. Got another one, for more money than the original. üëç

**Toothpaste:** Had two furry feeling days before I found more. A lot of hotels have tiiiiiny little two-squirt packs so now one of those lives in my frame bag as a backup.

**Skewer Nut:** I changed my cassette and lost the skewer nut off the back. I traded for the front nut and [ziptied the bastard on](/euro-trip-losing-an-axel-nut/). It's the most scared I've been in years.

## Summary

It's going great folks! Currently in East Europe in Czech, and I'm about to go on a rampage ticking off as many countries as possible. Camping equipment is gonna meet me in Prague , with a tarp and bivvy from Alp Kit. Might talk about that next.
