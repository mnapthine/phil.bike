# Phil.Bike

My bike blog has moved from Medium to Gatsby, using the amazing [Gatsby Casper](https://gatsby-casper.netlify.com/) starter pack for now.

It's a port of [Casper](https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper) v2 a theme from [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) for [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

Feel free to PR anything I messed up and let me know where to send you a coffee.
